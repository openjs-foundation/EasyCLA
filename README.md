# TEST-EasyCLA
This is for testing the EasyCLA flow and will be deleted after testing is complete

Please feel free to open a PR against this repo to test the flow for signing the CLA. Initially, if you have not signed the OpenJS Foundation CLA, your PR should be blocked. Once you sign the CLA (either by having your company add you as an approved contributor, or if you aren't employed, signing as an individual contributor) your PR should be unblocked. At this point, you will be able to contribute to any repo covered by the OpenJS CLA.

If you are contributing on behalf of a company, you will have the opportunity to designate your CLA manager. If you are unsure who this should be, please ask your manager or your legal department who is able to sign for the company.
